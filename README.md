# Conjure

Conjure is a competitive TCG player's best friend. It's your game assistant before, during and after every match. You can keep track of your different decks, theirs wins/loss records and see turn-by-turn breakdowns of each of your games. 

Conjure was designed around how I would keep track of my games, and how I noticed a lot of other competitive players keeping score during games. Now you can have an easy view of how each match progresses, while it's happening. 

The full version includes unlimited deck slots, match history, 9 additional themes and the ability to save format defaults. Conjure is a passion project of mine, and all the money I earn helps me keep working on it (and buy more cards).

### Know Issues
- Activity indicator spins while requesting store content after purchase.
- Ties currently end in a loss for Player One.
- Moving back from the theme selection can introduce selection bugs.
- Sometimes the UIPickerView initializes with only one button.
- You can still restore a purchase even if you've purchased the app.
